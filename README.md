# Demon Slayer Shader for Blender 2.9+
A shader for Blender forked from the open-source ArcSys [shader](https://github.com/Aerthas/BLENDER-Arc-System-Works-Shader) by Aerthas, hacked to work with models from the game Demon Slayer â€“ The Hinokami Chronicles.

## Usage
1. Download the shader here.
2. Append the material *Demon Slayer Shader* to your project.
3. Plug the textures to their respective slots **if applicable.**

## Notes
This shader does not aim to accurately replicate the game's shader, but rather to implement functionality with the models. Feel free to modify it to your own needs.

## Special Thanks
Aerthas - for the main shader I modified.
